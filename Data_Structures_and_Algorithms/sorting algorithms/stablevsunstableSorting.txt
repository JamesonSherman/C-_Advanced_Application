Stable vs Unstable Sorting
if we have 
5714581 as values sorted we get 1145567
under normal stable sorting algorithms the order of movement is preserved meaning
that the repeated values line up in order specific to where there previous
counterparts were
(i.e. if value [0] is 5 then it will be the first 5 in memory in the new ordered
list.)

Unstable sorts do not preserve the relative order of sorting. 
there is no difference in the specific order or values and it causes no harm
but with objects with specific key identifiers it can cause incredible harm if the 
specific value was in an original order (i.e. customers by alphabetical name etc)

in majority of cases you want to avoid this unstable sort method
