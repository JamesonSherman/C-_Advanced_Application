this is a current project in the making. This is a xamarin forms application that will be able to pin and select specific areas by 
gps location. You will be able to mark notes about a specifc location via Latitude and Longitude and then display the pin via a map
tab. 

Current technologies used:
SQLite
Xamarin.Forms.
Xamarin.Forms.Maps
NewtonSoft.JSON
Mobile Permissions
Google Developers MAPS API
FourSquare Pin Location API


Current Features Implemented:
Current SQLite implementation is done.
all entries for DB can be added, manipulated and deleted\
Maps is up and running so gps location can be accessible
Maps can pivot and follow with updated gps location
Permissions for accessing fine and coarse location are done.


TODO:
add in map pins for significant local locations
add in profile feature to house history of locations and favorite pins
add in better password and login credential system.
refact to make the permissions not be literally a heap of nested classes and methods.
